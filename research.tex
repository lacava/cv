%I research local search methods for topological search of model structures. I have developed both gradient-based and symbolic regression methods for formulating succinct and accurate models of complex systems. As an NSF IGERT fellow studying offshore wind energy, I have applied these methods to the identification of new models of wind turbine dynamics, vortex-induced vibration, and bald eagle behavior around wind farms, in addition to providing software to other researchers at UMass. \\
